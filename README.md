# Novel-Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Deployment
Looking to deploy a novel machine learning algorithm in a container on docker. Will provide data to train the model and will provide inputs in the form of JSONs and outputs in the form of JSONs.

There shall be the ability for the SRL agent to receive system calls via a RESTful API. The application shall be web based with a log in credential required, and shall be able to receive calls from other microservices in the network. Security must be built into the application.

Manager shall have the ability to manage subscribers who are assigned certificates to the microservice.
=================
To deploy a novel machine learning algorithm in a containerized environment using Docker, and integrate it with a RESTful API, we need to break down the task into several components. Here's how to structure the solution:
High-Level Architecture

    Machine Learning Model:
        Train the model on the provided dataset and serialize it (using joblib or pickle) for future predictions.

    Containerization (Docker):
        The ML model, backend, and the RESTful API will be containerized using Docker. This allows for portability and scalability.

    RESTful API:
        A REST API will be developed using Flask (or FastAPI) to handle incoming requests. The API will:
            Accept inputs as JSON.
            Run the machine learning model.
            Return outputs as JSON.

    User Authentication:
        The application will require user login credentials, which will be implemented using OAuth2 (or similar methods) for secure login and session management.

    Microservice Communication:
        The microservices will communicate with each other over HTTP via REST API calls.

    Security:
        Implement SSL encryption for secure communication.
        Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for user and subscriber management.

    Manager's Dashboard:
        The manager can manage users and assign certificates to them.

Detailed Implementation

Here’s a breakdown of the steps to build this solution.
Step 1: Set up the Machine Learning Model

First, ensure you have your machine learning model trained and saved for deployment. Here’s an example using scikit-learn for a simple classifier:

import joblib
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Train the model (assuming you're using a simple classifier for demonstration)
iris = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(iris.data, iris.target, test_size=0.3)

clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the trained model to a file
joblib.dump(clf, 'model.pkl')

You can replace the above classifier with your own novel model.
Step 2: Set up the RESTful API (Flask Example)

Next, we’ll create a simple Flask-based REST API to load the model and make predictions. The Flask app will receive JSON input, make predictions, and return the results as JSON.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import joblib
import numpy as np

# Load the model
model = joblib.load('model.pkl')

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route to receive the input JSON and return the prediction
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.get_json()  # Get input JSON
    if 'features' not in data:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing 'features' in request"}), 400
    
    features = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)  # Convert to numpy array for model input
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    
    return jsonify({"prediction": int(prediction[0])})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 3: Dockerize the Flask Application

Create a Dockerfile to package the Flask app and its dependencies into a Docker container.

# Use the official Python image from Docker Hub
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the local code to the container
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose the API port
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the Flask app
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

Step 4: Create requirements.txt

Make sure to include the required libraries in the requirements.txt file.

Flask
joblib
scikit-learn
numpy

Step 5: Docker Compose Setup (Optional for Microservices)

If you're dealing with multiple microservices that need to interact, you can use Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers.

Here’s an example of a docker-compose.yml file:

version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - backend
  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    networks:
      - backend
networks:
  backend:
    driver: bridge

This will set up an API container and a Postgres database container that can be used for storing user and subscription data.
Step 6: Add User Authentication (OAuth2 / JWT)

For security, you can use Flask-Login or Flask-JWT-Extended to handle user authentication and authorization. Below is an example using Flask-JWT-Extended for token-based authentication.

pip install Flask-JWT-Extended

Example Flask code for authentication:

from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required, create_access_token
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["JWT_SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret-key"  # Change to a secure key
jwt = JWTManager(app)

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.json.get('username')
    password = request.json.get('password')
    
    # Validate user credentials (this is just a placeholder)
    if username == "admin" and password == "password":
        access_token = create_access_token(identity=username)
        return jsonify(access_token=access_token)
    
    return jsonify({"msg": "Bad username or password"}), 401

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required()
def predict():
    # Your prediction code here
    return jsonify({"prediction": "success"})

Step 7: Secure Communication (SSL)

To secure communication between services and to ensure sensitive data is encrypted, configure SSL in your Flask app (via Flask-Talisman) and make sure your Docker container exposes the service over HTTPS.

pip install flask-talisman

In your Flask app:

from flask_talisman import Talisman

app = Flask(__name__)
talisman = Talisman(app)

In the Docker configuration, you would need to configure SSL certificates and expose port 443 instead of 5000.
Step 8: Manage Subscribers

For managing subscribers and certificates, consider using a database (like PostgreSQL) to store user and subscription data. The manager could have access to a web interface to view and assign certificates. Flask-Admin can be used for building simple admin interfaces.

pip install flask-admin

Then, in your Flask app, you can set up a simple admin interface for managing users:

from flask_admin import Admin
from flask_admin.contrib.sqla import ModelView
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///subscribers.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Subscriber(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50))
    certificate = db.Column(db.String(100))

admin = Admin(app, name='Subscriber Admin')
admin.add_view(ModelView(Subscriber, db.session))

Step 9: Deploying the Solution

    Build the Docker image:

docker build -t ai-ml-api .

    Run the container locally:

docker run -p 5000:5000 ai-ml-api

    Deploy on Cloud: For production use, you can deploy this Docker container on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure) with a proper load balancer and a secured environment.

    Use CI/CD Pipeline: Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins) to automate testing and deployment of the application.

Conclusion

This approach helps you create a RESTful API that can handle machine learning predictions, securely manage user authentication, and enable interaction with other microservices. Docker helps you containerize everything, ensuring portability and ease of scaling.
